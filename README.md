# FEATURES

## Secure and open source VPN
ProtonVPN helps keep you safe on the internet, preventing your ISP and government from spying on you and websites you visit from identifying and tracking you.

## Secure Core servers
For additional security, you can route your connection through one of our Secure Core servers before connecting to another ProtonVPN server in any country. Secure Core servers are under our direct control and are located in privacy-friendly jurisdictions.

## Kill Switch and Always-on VPN
Our Kill Switch disables your internet connection if the VPN disconnects. Always-on VPN automatically re-establishes a connection to our servers. These features ensure that ProtonVPN keeps your data safe even if your connection is interrupted.

## Based in Switzerland with a no-logs policy
ProtonVPN is headquartered in Switzerland, which is home to some of the world's strongest data privacy laws and free from American and European surveillance agreements. Swiss law does not require us to keep logs of users' internet activity, allowing us to maintain a strict no-logs policy and protect our users' privacy.

## Adblocker (NetShield)
Our apps use DNS filtering to prevent your browser from loading websites that host malware, and to block ads and online trackers. NetShield is available for Basic, Plus and Visionary users.

#### Strong Encryption 
We use only the highest strength encryption to protect your Internet connection. This means all your network traffic is encrypted with AES-256, key exchange is done with 4096-bit RSA, and HMAC with SHA384 is used for message authentication.

#### Forward Secrecy
We have carefully selected our encryption cipher suites to only include ones that have Perfect Forward Secrecy. This means that your encrypted traffic cannot be captured and decrypted later if the encryption key from a subsequent session gets compromised. With each connection, we generate a new encryption key, so a key is never used for more than one session.

#### Strong Protocols
We use only VPN protocols which are known to be secure - IKEv2/IPSec and OpenVPN. ProtonVPN does not have any servers that support PPTP and L2TP/IPSec, even though they are less costly to operate. By using ProtonVPN, you can be confident that your VPN tunnel is protected by the most reliable protocol.

#### Full Disk Encryption
Although virtually no personally identifiable data is stored on them anyway, all ProtonVPN servers are protected by full disk encryption. This helps secure them from resource-intensive man-in-the-middle attacks of the kind that can be performed by governments. Full disk encryption secures server certificates and all other configurations and software stored on an exit server, so that even if the server is somehow compromised, attackers would not be able to access any data stored on it.

#### Swiss Based
In addition to strong technical security, ProtonVPN also benefits from strong legal protection. Because we are based in Switzerland, ProtonVPN is protected by some of the world's strongest privacy laws and remains outside of US and EU jurisdiction. This means that unlike VPN providers based in a fourteen eyes country, we cannot be coerced into spying on our users.

#### Trusted 
It is important you use a trustworthy VPN, which is why we are one of the only VPN companies that is transparent about exactly who is running the service. Our team has a long track record in security, having previously built ProtonMail - the world's largest encrypted email service. Whether it is challenging governments, educating the public, or training journalists, we have a long history of fighting for privacy online and contributing to the open source community.

#### Open Source 
Founded by MIT and CERN scientists, ProtonVPN believes in transparency and peer review. Our apps are 100% open source, so anyone can examine our code. This transparency means that you can have confidence that our apps are doing what they are supposed to be doing, and only what they are supposed to be doing. You can see the code for all our apps on GitHub.

#### Independently Audited 
Although being open source means that our code can be checked by anyone, there is usually no guarantee that it has been. ProtonVPN has commissioned professional audits for all our full-release software from SEC Consult. And unlike some VPN companies, we publish the full results of these audits online for all to see.

#### Physical Security
We have gone to extreme lengths to protect ProtonVPN's Secure Core servers to ensure their security. Critical infrastructure in Switzerland is located in a former Swiss army fallout shelter 1000 meters below the surface. Similarly, our Iceland infrastructure resides in a secure former military base. Our servers in Sweden are also located in an underground data center. By shipping our own equipment to these locations, we ensure that our servers are also secure at the hardware level.
